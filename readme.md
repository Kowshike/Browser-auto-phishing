## Browser Autofill Phishing üêü


This project is a demonstration of how hidden form fields can be unintentionally filled using the browser's autofill feature, posing a significant security risk. Users are often unaware that their sensitive data may be exposed to malicious websites by this mechanism.

How Autofill Works and the Risks
How Autofill Operates
Browsers like Google Chrome, Safari, and Firefox use autofill to simplify form completion by storing user information like name, email, address, and payment details. When a user interacts with an input field, the browser identifies matching stored data and fills out all visible and some hidden fields.

## The Security Risks
* Data Leakage: Hidden fields that are out of view or styled off-screen can still be autofilled, allowing attackers to collect sensitive information such as phone numbers, credit card details, and addresses.
* Identity Theft: Users may inadvertently disclose personal data to malicious actors posing as legitimate websites.
* Lack of Transparency: Some browsers don't explicitly notify users about all the fields being autofilled, making it easier for attackers to exploit this feature.
* Browser Behavior Comparison
* Google Chrome
* Automatically fills visible and some hidden form fields upon user interaction with the first field.
* Users may not be aware of the hidden fields being filled.
* Safari Provides better transparency by showing users all data being autofilled, even for hidden fields, before completing the action.
* Firefox Requires explicit user action to autofill fields. Users must right-click on a field and choose an identity to fill the form providing more control over the data.
* Insights on Mitigation
To safeguard against browser autofill phishing, consider the following:

## For Users
Disable Autofill for Sensitive Data:

Most browsers allow users to disable autofill for sensitive information like credit cards and addresses.
Check browser settings and turn off autofill for forms.
Be Cautious with Unknown Websites:

Avoid using autofill on websites that you don‚Äôt trust or haven‚Äôt verified.
Regularly Review Stored Data:

Periodically review and delete outdated or unnecessary data stored in the browser.
## For Developers
Limit Form Scope:

Use proper autocomplete attributes (e.g., autocomplete="off") for sensitive fields to prevent browsers from autofilling these.
Educate Users:

Provide clear information about the autofill feature and its risks on your website.
Transparent Design:

Avoid designing forms with hidden or off-screen fields to gain user trust.
## Real-Life Scenarios
Phishing Websites: Attackers design forms to appear legitimate, hiding malicious fields that collect sensitive data like phone numbers and payment details when autofill is used.

Third-Party Scripts: Malicious scripts embedded in legitimate websites could exploit autofill features to extract user data.

## Browser Extensions: 
Rogue browser extensions may mimic autofill behavior to harvest stored user information.

## How to Stay Safe
Use a password manager instead of relying on browser autofill for sensitive credentials.
Keep your browser updated to ensure you benefit from the latest security features.
Avoid enabling autofill for financial or personal information unless absolutely necessary.
